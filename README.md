# Sticky Notes Application

## Description:

This web app integrates a React.js as frontend and Express.js framework with a MongoDB database as backend.

Sticky Notes was build as a Responsive Single Page Application so it manages desktop, tablet and mobile widths and it can be easy to scaled it.

Currently the backend works with endpoints for get, update, delete notes due to free database storage capacity provided by MongoDB.

Frontend components modified, I used a open library that I did with others team workers when I used to work at The Ksquare Group, you can find it in npm website by the name zanma-react-components. It also was built on Storybook using React.js, Typescript, Css and Javascript.

Frontend runs with yarn start and Backend does with npm start.

## Next versions:

- Implementation users database and an authentication to users Log in.

- Addition of style for main layout page.

- Addition of config to run backend with frontend.

## Technology stack used:

Frontend: React js, Typescript, Styled-components and a library called Zanma-react-components. Used Yarn as a package manager.

Backend: Express, nodemon, Mongoose, body-parser, dotenv and MongoDB. Used NPM as a package manager.

## Installation:

Pretty much everything you need to install after cloning repository are the technology stack mentioned before,
so for any doubts or information, contact me.
